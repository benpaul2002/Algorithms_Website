            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Dynamic Programming algorithms involve taking a problem and breaking it down to smaller sub-problems
                recursively. The solution to each sub-problem is stored so as to avoid computation of that sub-problem, 
                should it arise again. This allows the overall problem to solved efficiently as well. <br><br>
                In general, for a dynamic programming problem, we have 3 steps - 
                <ol>
                    <li>Getting the subproblems such that a <b>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</b> can be formed</li>
                    <li>Getting the formula by using the DAG to pose the problem</li>
                    <li>Executing the formula in the correct order</li>
                </ol>

            <h1>\(n^{th}\) Fibonacci Number</h1>
            <p>
                Dynamic Programming is best understood using the example of finding the \(n^{th}\) Fibonacci number. <br><br>
                Since the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers such that any number is the sum of the previous 
                two numbers (first two numbers are 0 and 1 respectively), we can easily find the \(n^{th}\) Fibonacci 
                number using the following recursive algorithm - 
                \[f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)\] <br>
                However, it turns out that this is inefficient. <br>
                For example, if we use this algorithm to find \(f(4\), then we would first recursively call \(f(3)\) and 
                \(f(2)\). However, \(f(3)\) will in turn call \(f(2)\) and \(f(1)\). <br>
                Immediately we can see that \(f(2)\) is computed twice. While this is acceptable for small values of \(n\), 
                this algorithm will become extremely slow for even slightly large values of \(n\), say 50. <br><br>
                This is where Dynamic Programming comes in. Most of the algorithm remains the same as above. All we need 
                to do is store the value of any Fibonacci number that is computed. <br>
                So, by the time we compute \(f(3)\), we will have already stored the value of \(f(2)\). So, we avoid extra 
                computations and the algorithm becomes far more effecient.

            <h1>Shortest Path in DAG</h1>
            <p>
                In this problem, we are given a DAG, a source and a destination, and we need to find the shortest distance 
                between the source and the destination. <br>
                In this problem, we will require toposort.

            <p id="hiddenP1">
                Toposort is an algorithm which is used to sort the nodes of a directed graph in such a way that for every 
                directed edge from a node \(A\) to a node \(B\), node \(A\) appears before node \(B\). <br><br>
                A real world example of this - Say you want to enroll in a particular course in a university. You will first 
                have to complete all the prerequisites for that course, and those prerequisites may have prerequisites of 
                their own. Toposort will give you the order (there may be multiple correct orders) in which you can take each 
                course so as to enable you to take the course you desire. <br><br>
                Essentially, if you have a directed graph and you do toposort on it, you will get an order where each edge 
                from a node points to a node on the right. <br><br>

            </p>
            <p>
                Now, for this problem, let us assume we have a DAG with nodes \(s, v_1, v_2, ..., v_{n-2}, d\), where \(s\) is 
                the source and \(d\) is the destination. <br>
                First, we do toposort on the DAG. Assume, without any loss in generality, that the resulting order is \(s, v_1, 
                v_2, ..., v_{n-2}, d\). <br><br>
                Notice that, using this order, we can easily break the problem into subproblems. <br>
                For example, the shortest path from \(s\) to \(d\) is the shortest path from \(s\) to \(u\) and the edge 
                connecting \(u\) to \(d\). Here, \(u\) is the node which is connected to \(d\) and is the shortest distance away 
                from \(s\). <br><br>
                Now, consider the following algorithm - <br>
            </p>
            <p class="coloredP">
                &emsp;&ensp;initialize \(dist(v)\) to be \(\infty\) for every node \(v\) <br>
                &emsp;&ensp;\(dist(s) = 0\) <br>
                &emsp;&ensp;for each \(v \in V\backslash \{s\}\) <br>
                &emsp;&ensp;\(dist(v) = min_{(u,v)\in E}\{dist(u)+l(u,v)\}\)
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, \(dist(v)\) represents shortest path from \(s\) to \(v\). <br>
                \(V\backslash \{s\}\) represents the set \(V\) without the element \(s\). <br> 
                \(l(u,v)\) represents the weight of the edge between \(u\) and \(v\). <br><br>
                So, this algorithm helps us find the shortest path in DAG fairly easily.

            <h1>Longest Increasing Subsequence</h1>
            <p>
                A subsequence of a sequence can be obtained by removing some (or even none) of the elements of the sequence, 
                while maintaining the order of the sequence. <br>
                An increasing subsequence is a subsequence where the elements are sorted in ascending order. <br><br>
                So, in this problem, we are given a sequence of numbers. We are required to find the largest of all the 
                increasing subsequences of this sequence. <br><br>
                Let's say we have the sequence \(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\). <br>
                Let's associate each element of the sequence to a node in a graph. There will be an edge between two nodes 
                \(i\) and \(j\) if and only if \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) are consecutive elements of some increasing subsequence. 
                That is, if \(i < j\), then there will be an edge from node \(i\) to node \(j\) if \(a_i < a_j\). <br><br> 
                This is a graph of all permissible transitions. It is clear that this graph is a DAG. <br>
                Every path in this DAG will be a valid increasing sequence. So, the output of our problem will be the longest 
                of these paths. <br>
                Note that we do not know our source here. The longest path may start from any node. <br><br>
                Now, let \(L(j)\) represent the longest path ending at \(j\). So, we can break the problem into subproblems 
                since \(L(j) = 1+max\{L(i):(i,j)\in E\}\), where \(i\) is a neighbour of \(j\). We're adding 1 since the edges 
                don't have weights; we're just counting number of edges. <br>
                So, we need to find \(L(j) \ \forall \ 1≤j≤n\). <br><br>
                Consider the following algorithm - <br>
            </p>
            <p class="coloredP">
                &emsp;&ensp;for \(j\) = 1, 2, ..., \(n\): <br>
                &emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&ensp;\(L(j) = 1+max\{L(i):(i,j)\in E\}\) <br>
                &emsp;&ensp;return \(max_jL(j)\) <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that to get the longest subsequence itself (and not just its length), we will need to store the indices 
                where \(L(j)\) was maximum.

            <h1>Shortest Reliable Path</h1>
            <p>
                In this problem, we need to find the shortest path between two points \(s\) and \(t\) of a graph \(G\) such that 
                the path uses at most \(k\) edges.
            </p>
            <button class="hiddenPbtn" onclick="hideP('hiddenP2')">Why is this problem relevant?</button>
            <p id="hiddenP2">
                In networking, packets may get dropped at routers because of congestion and so, taking more than \(k\) jumps may 
                cause the packets to never reach the destination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let \(dist(v,i)\) represent the length of the shortest path from \(s\) to \(v\) using at most \(i\) steps, where 
                \(i≤k\). So, the final solution will be given by \(dist(t,k)\). <br>
                Clearly, we can write \(dist(v,i)\) as \(min_{(u,v)\in E}\{dist(u,i-1)+l(u,v)\}\), where the \(u\) is the previous 
                node (before \(v\)). <br><br>
                In this manner, we can easily solve the entire problem. <br><br>
                What happens if there is no path with less than or equal to \(k\) edges? Then, we will have no solution to this 
                problem. <br>
                What happens if \(k≥n\) (\(n\) is the number of edges in \(G\))? Then, this problem is the same as finding the 
                shortest path. This case can be solved using a greedy approach, which is always preferred over other approaches.
